[NOTE.speaker]
--
In order to follow along in this lab you will need to have each of these installed.
--

== The Code

[NOTE.speaker]
--
You can fork it first if you want but this is all that is needed to download the code.
This repo has both the code and these slides.
--

== Deploy it

[source]
----
cd [APP-SERVER]/bin
----

*Next*

[source]
----
mvn clean package jboss-as:deploy
----

*OR*

[source]
----
mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Depending on which app server you are running, choose the appropriate Maven command.
--

== View it

http://localhost:8080/jboss-contacts-responsive/index.html

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Once you have everything running you should see the app here.

== Responsiveness
image::keep-mobile-and-be-responsive.png[Responsive]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
On the slides this image is too *large* for the slide and therefore is not responsive.
--

== Responsive ???
image::keep-mobile-and-be-responsive.png[Responsive, height=200]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
On the slides this image is too *small* for the slide and therefore is not responsive.
--

== Responsive
image::keep-mobile-and-be-responsive.png[Responsive, height=500]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
On the slides this image is sized correctly but is still not responsive.
--

== Terms

//[%step]
* Progressive Enhancement
* Responsive Web Design
* Mobile First

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Progressive Enhancement* - "advocates starting with functional, meaningful HTML and
then unobtrusively layering presentations (CSS) and behavior (JS) on top for a richer,
more dynamic user experience." - Jehl

*Responsive Web Design* - "In 2010, Ethan Marcotte coined the term to describe an
approach to web layout that comibines _fluid grids_, _flexible images_, and CSS3 _media queries_
to deliver layouts that repsond (downright magically) to their environment." - Jehl

*Mobile First* - "helps us to prioritize content, since there is not enough room a on
small screen for non-crtical content" and "A mobile-first responsive stylesheet begins with
styles that are shared across all experiences, forming the foundation of the smallest
screen layout. These styles are followed by a series of mostly min-width media queries
to scale that layout up to greater viewport sizes and pixel depths." - Jehl
--

== CSS reset

[source, language="css"]
----
html, body, div, span, applet, object, iframe, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p,
	blockquote, pre, a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code, del, dfn,
	em, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp, small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var,
	b, u, i, center, dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li, fieldset, form, label, legend,
	table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td, article, aside, canvas,
	details, embed, figure, figcaption, footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav,
	output, ruby, section, summary, time, mark, audio, video {
		margin: 0;
		padding: 0;
		border: 0;
		font-size: 100%;
		font: inherit;
		vertical-align: baseline;
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Each browser has different baseline settings for core elements. A reset will create
a common baseline.

This has already been applied to the project, so there is no need to implement it.
Just be aware of it and that it will reset things like <h1>.
--

== Font Sizing

[source, language="css"]
----
h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
This needs to be set since we _reset_ the <h1> element.

* font-size was set to 100%
* 100% == base size
* Change h1 to be larger again
--

=== Sizing Problems

24px is a *fixed* size

=== Fixing Sizing

* base type size == 16px
* target / context = result
* 24 / 16 = 1.5

[source, language=""]
----
h1 {
  font-size: 1.5em; /* 24px / 16px */
  font-weight: bold;
}

----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
On most systems the base size is 16px. We can use that base context to mathmatically
determine the flexible size in *em* units. We do this by dividing the target size,
in this case 24px, by the context size, 16px, and we get the result of 1.5em.
--

=== Don't Round

11 / 24 = 0.458333333333333

[NOTE.speaker]
--
It is tempting to round a figure like this to 0.46 but that would not be the correct
size. Instead the browser can handle the long ugly number, so let it. You will have
more accurate sizings.
--

=== Coding time

[%step]
* Search for *font-size* and change the _pixels_ to '_em_'s
* tag01-font-size

== Layout

[source, language="css"]
----
body {
	width: 960px;
}

div .main {
  width: 900px;
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The width of the main section is determined in pixels.
--

=== Flexible Layout

[source, language="css"]
----
body {
	width: 960px;
}

div .main {
  width: 93.75%; /* 900px / 960px */
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The main section is within the body. The body is the context and the main section is the target.
Divide them to find the resulting percentage.

Sometimes you may want to use em's instead of percentage, especially when text height is involved.

Using Chrome dev tools helps here, letting you change or compare different values without building the code.
--

=== Coding time

[%step]
* Search for *px* and change them to % or '_em_'s
* tag02-flexible-layout

== User Agent (UA) Sniffing

Device detection

[NOTE.speaker]
--
"Perhaps the most common criticism of user agent sniffing is that the information a
browser provides isn't always reliable. Browsers, networks, and even users sometimes
modify user agent information for myriad reasons" - Jehl
--

== viewport

[source, language="html"]
----
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Originally created for Mobile Safari in 2007 but was soon adopted by the other browsers
and became a psuedo-standard.
--

=== viewport.next

[source, language="css"]
----
@-webkit-viewport{width:device-width}
@-moz-viewport{width:device-width}
@-ms-viewport{width:device-width}
@-o-viewport{width:device-width}
@viewport{width:device-width}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
"The W3C has standardized an approach to specifying viewport style information
such as width and scale, and it's handled via CSS instead of HTML" - Jehl
--

=== Coding time

[%step]
* Add the _viewport_ settings to all the HTML files and the main CSS file
* tag03-viewport

== @media queries

[source, language="css"]
----
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  body {
    font-size: 100%;
  }
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Originally the plan was to have each device express it's own _media_ type. However
the mobile devices did not adopt this method of identification. Some of the earliest
mobile devices had very simple web browsers. Additionally the only media type,
_handheld_ could not cover all the various sizes there were coming out. So other means were needed.

Media queries provide the answer. They enable us to examine the physical characteristics
of the device viewing the webpage.
--

=== The Features

|===
|width |aspect-ratio |monochrome
|height |device-aspect-ratio |resolution
|device-width |color |scan
|device-height |color-index |orientation
|===

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Most of these features have _min-_ and _max-_ aspects to them.
--

== Redux

[%step]
* Make a back-up copy of the CSS file
* Remove all styles but the CSS Reset
* Carefully add back in the sytles that are needed for a minimum layout

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Taking both Progressive Enhancement and Mobile First philosophies we start with
a minimal approach first. Only using those styles that all devises should be
able to use and display. Nothing fancy here.
