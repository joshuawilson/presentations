Some times there is too much content to fit my container.

== Responsiveness
image::keep-mobile-and-be-responsive.png[Responsive]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
On the slides this image is too *large* for the slide and therefore is not responsive.

== Responsive ???

[NOTE.speaker]
--
On the slides this image is too *small* for the slide and therefore is not responsive.

On the slides this image is sized correctly but is still not responsive.

== CSS reset

		padding: 0;
		border: 0;
		font-size: 100%;
		font: inherit;
		vertical-align: baseline;
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Each browser has different baseline settings for core elements. A reset will create
a common baseline.

This has already been applied to the project, so there is no need to implement it.
Just be aware of it and that it will reset things like <h1>.
--

== Font Sizing

[source, language="css"]
----
h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
This needs to be set since we _reset_ the <h1> element.

* font-size was set to 100%
* 100% == base size
* Change h1 to be larger again
--

== Sizing Problems

24px is a *fixed* size

== Fixing Sizing

* base type size == 16px
* target / context = result
* 24 / 16 = 1.5

[source, language="css"]
----
h1 {
  font-size: 1.5em; /* 24px / 16px */
  font-weight: bold;
}

----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
On most systems the base size is 16px. We can use that base context to mathmatically
determine the flexible size in *em* units. We do this by dividing the target size,
in this case 24px, by the context size, 16px, and we get the result of 1.5em.
--

== Layout

[source, language="css"]
----
body {
  width: 960px;
}

div .main {
  width: 900px;
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The width of the main section is determined in pixels.
--

== Flexible Layout

[source, language="css"]
----
body {
  width: 960px;
}

div .main {
  width: 93.75%; /* 900px / 960px */
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The main section is within the body. The body is the context and the main section is the target.
Divide them to find the resulting percentage.

Sometimes you may want to use em's instead of percentage, especially when text height is involved.

Using Chrome dev tools helps here, letting you change or compare different values without building the code.
--

== viewport

[source, language="html"]
----
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Originally created for Mobile Safari in 2007 but was soon adopted by the other browsers
and became a psuedo-standard.
--

== @media queries

[source, language="css"]
----
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  body {
    font-size: 100%;
  }
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Originally the plan was to have each device express it's own _media_ type. However
the mobile devices did not adopt this method of identification. Some of the earliest
mobile devices had very simple web browsers. Additionally the only media type,
_handheld_ could not cover all the various sizes there were coming out. So other means were needed.

Media queries provide the answer. They enable us to examine the physical characteristics
of the device viewing the webpage.
