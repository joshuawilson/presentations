== What is MVC?

MVC is a pattern used to implement a user interface (UI).

It consists of 3 major components

* **M**odel
* **V**iew
* **C**ontroller

== The **M**odel in MVC

The model is the interim state you want to keep when you are building an
application that shows a user interface

Examples

* Who is logged in
* What are they trying to buy
* What page are they on in a multi page flow

== The **V**iew in MVC

The view is what your user interacts with

In a web application that would be the web page or web pages

* your JSP page
* your CSS styles
* your JavaScript

//In a thick client scenario it would be the entire UI

//In an embedded scenario it could be the touch screen, hardware buttons etc.

== The **C**ontroller in MVC

The controller is the work horse of the pattern, as it:

|===
|Task | Example

|Executes the business logic
|Run a credit card transaction

|Updates the model
|Mark the transaction as successful in the model object

|Ask the view to render itself
|Shows the transaction was successful

|===

== Different styles of MVC

Component-based MVC

Action-based MVC

== Component-based MVC (Pull)

A specific style of MVC made popular by component frameworks

Controller provided by the framework

Examples

* Java Server Faces (in the JavaEE platform)
* Seam (discontinued)
* Wicket
* Tapestry
* Lift
* uMircro
* Apache Click (retired)

=== Component MVC

== Action-based MVC (Push)

Controller(s) defined by the application

Examples

* Spring MVC
* Struts 2
* Django
* Ruby on Rails
* Symfony
* Yii
* Stripes
* Play
* CodeIgniter
* VRaptor
* Spark-java

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Currently no JavaEE implementation

Good news we are creating one!

=== Action MVC

=== Spring MVC life cycle

=== Spring MVC

== Compare and Contrast

|===
|Action-based MVC |Component-based MVC

|Manual request parameter processing
|Automatic request parameter procession

|No view kept around
|View kept around

|Limited support for re-usable behavior
|Component libraries that implement re-usable behavior

|Developer responsible for all HTML / JavaScript
|Components render HTML / JavaScript

|No automatic input conversion
|Automatic input conversion

|No automatic input validation
|Automatic input validation

|Request centric
|Page centric

|===

== The JavaEE 8 MVC 1.0 JSR

Why now?

* JavaEE 8 survey
* Talking to customers
* UI landscape is not one size fits all
* JavaEE is about standards

//What are we looking at?

//* Tight CDI integration
//* Build on top of exiting APIs

=== Where

Where are we at?

* The JSR has been approved
* We have the EG up and running

=== How

How can I help?

* Join the users@mvc-spec.java.net mailinglist and comment
* Participate in the Adopt-a-JSR program (JUGs)
* Test out snapshots (once available) from the RI website
* (http://ozark.java.net) and file issues if something is not working
* Tweet, blog, socialize to raise awareness about MVC 1.0

=== An example about the EG process

We just finished discussing about the following question:
“Do we build on top of JAX-RS or not?”

Since the users@mvc-spec.java.net mailing list gets every mail the EG sends
you can follow this discussion as well

What do you think?

* Tell us on the mailing list
* Tweet about it
* Talk to me after the session

//== Another couple of things being discussed

//Programmatic API so you can change the runtime behavior

//Type conversion of form inputs

//An SPI to plug in a different view technology

//* Velocity
//* Freemarker
//* Thymeleaf
//* … Your view technology …

== MVC vs JSF examples
